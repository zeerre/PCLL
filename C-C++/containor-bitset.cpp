//Member functions
//(constructor)                 Construct bitset (public member function) 
//applicable operators          Bitset operators (functions) 
//
//Bit access:
//operator[]                    Access bit (public member function) 
//
//
//Bit operations:
//set                           Set bits (public member function) 
//reset                         Reset bits (public member function) 
//flip                          Flip bits (public member function) 
//
//
//Bitset operations:
//to_ulong                      Convert to unsigned long integer (public member function) 
//to_string                     Convert to string (public member function) 
//count                         Count bits set (public member function) 
//size                          Return size (public member function) 
//test                          Return bit value (public member function) 
//any                           Test if any bit is set (public member function) 
//none                          Test if no bit is set (public member function) 
//
