//1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l. 
//Here level is the number of nodes on the path from the root to the node (including root and node). Level of the root is 0. 
//This can be proved by induction. 
//For root, l = 0, number of nodes = 20 = 1 
//Assume that the maximum number of nodes on level ‘l’ is 2l 
//Since in Binary tree every node has at most 2 children, next level would have twice nodes, i.e. 2 * 2l 
//
//2) The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1. 
//Here the height of a tree is the maximum number of nodes on the root to leaf path. Height of a tree with a single node is considered as 1. 
//This result can be derived from point 2 above. A tree has maximum nodes if all levels have maximum nodes. So maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is 1 + 2 + 4 + .. + 2h-1. This is a simple geometric series with h terms and sum of this series is 2h– 1. 
//In some books, the height of the root is considered as 0. In this convention, the above formula becomes 2h+1 – 1 
//
//3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1).
//There should be at least one element on each level, so the height cannot be more than N. A binary tree of height ‘h’ can have maximum 2h – 1 nodes (previous property). So the number of nodes will be less than or equal to this maximum value.
//
//
//N <=  2h - 1
//2h >= N+1
//log2(2h) >= log2(N+1)           (Taking log both sides)
//hlog22 >= log2(N+1)       (h is an integer)
//h  >= | log2(N+1) |
//So the minimum height possible is | log2(N+1) |
//
//4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L |+ 1   levels. 
//A Binary tree has the maximum number of leaves (and a minimum number of levels) when all levels are fully filled. Let all leaves be at level l, then below is true for the number of leaves L. 
//
//L   <=  2l-1  [From Point 1]
//l =   | Log2L | + 1 
//where l is the minimum number of levels.
//5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
//
//L = T + 1
//Where L = Number of leaf nodes
//T = Number of internal nodes with two children
//Proof:
//No. of leaf nodes (L) i.e. total elements present at the bottom of tree = 
//2h-1 (h is height of tree)
//No. of internal nodes = {total no. of nodes} - {leaf nodes} = 
//{ 2h - 1 } - {2h-1} = 2h-1 (2-1) - 1 = 2h-1 - 1
//So , L = 2h-1
//     T = 2h-1 - 1
//Therefore L = T + 1
//Hence proved
//6) In a non empty binary tree, if n is the total number of nodes and e is the total number of edges, then e = n-1 
//
//Every node in a binary tree has exactly one parent with the exception of root node. So if n is the total
//number of nodes then n-1 nodes have exactly one parent. There is only one edge between any child and its
//parent. So the total number of edges is n-1.
